1) requires 20 states.
    Start linear: the player MUST play. So go from point 0 to point 1. 
                    If someone wants to back away from the mansion, let them get conked on the head. They are dragged in.
                        If conked they skip some of the linear intro states. But there is also a hidden handicap that will show up later. So they can't just use this as a shortcut. Results in a second ending, versus the main path. 
            After entering the mansion, there will be a scene where they are gassed and wake up in a delirium. That is where conked users wake up, too.
    No linear ending. There is no one ending that is arrived at in a linear path. Minimum two endings branch off from the main path. They are separate from the other ending, arrived at by being conked. 
        The two main endings are very different from each other. The branching path comes right after the delirious wake-up. 
    I want to have a MacGuffin that is necessary for the Good ending. It is available in the wake-up room and changes each path. 
    If you return to the mansion after restarting from the conk ending then there is a subtle clue.
        Basically, it is known by the user and by the developer that you were shown to have no choice - even tho this iteration of the character has not experienced the conking. Maybe, you become the conker?
    If you were conked, and then choose to conk, you will die. If you choose to conk but you were not conked, then you will live, but become dizzy for the rest of the adventure. 
    A secret ending for those who get all the other endings. 
    The conking consequence is actually a good thing - it alerts your character to some second macguffin that isnt otherwise accessible. But you still die. It opens a hidden passage in another storyline. At an earlier room than the macguffin. 

2) Must develop a choose your own adventure game. The core of it is the 20 states, and to get the character/narrative between the 20 states I need a storyline.
